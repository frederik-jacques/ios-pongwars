# Pongwars in Swift with SpriteKit

A Swift implementation of Pong Wars with SpriteKit inspired on the version Koen van Gilst made (https://github.com/vnglst/pong-wars) made as a fun Sunday afternoon project.

## Adjustments to original version
If you want to intervene with the eternal war between light & dark, you can tap on the ball and apply some force to it.
